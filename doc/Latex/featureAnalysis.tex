%\textbf{What we have to work with: topics, features, feature attributes}
In this section, we analyze the informativeness of our defined features in Sec~\ref{sec:dataStatistics} and the effect of their attributes on learning targeted topical. To this end, the goal is to answer the following questions in this section.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{What are the best features for learning social sensors and do they differ by topic?}
\item \textbf{For each feature type, do any attributes correlate with importance?}
\end{itemize}

A general method for measuring informativeness is Mutual Information which is a measure of amount of information one random variable contains about another random variable. In order to calculate amount of information that a feature $f_k \in \{from, hashtag, mention, term, location\}$ provides w.r.t $t_i \in \{NaturalDisaster, Epidemics, ...\}$, mutual information is defined as:

\begin{multline}
I(t_i, f_k)= \\
 \sum_{t_i\in \{ true, false \}} \sum_{f_k\in \{ true, false\}}p(f_k,t_i)\log \left ( \frac{p(f_k,t_i)}{p(f_k)p(t_i)} \right )
 \label{eq:eq1}
\end{multline}

Where higher values for this metric indicate more informative features for the specified topic.

In order to answer the first question on what are the best features for learning social sensors, we provide in Table ~\ref{fig:avgMI} mean of Mutual Information values for each feature across different topics. The last column in Table ~\ref{fig:avgMI} shows the average of mean Mutual Information for the feature. From analysis of Table ~\ref{fig:avgMI}, we can make a set of observations:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{Term} and \textit{Location} features are the most prevalent features.% and in general, the more features you have, the better the chance that one is useful.
\item A few topics such as \textit{IranDeal} and \textit{tennis} are less sensitive to the selection of a specific set of features.
\item The Location feature provides more information regarding \textit{HumanDisaster}, \textit{LBGT}, and \textit{Soccer} topics.
\item Sorting features based on their average mean values across different topics results in the following order for informativeness measure of features: \textit{Term}, \textit{Location}, \textit{Hashtag}, \textit{Mention}, \textit{From}.
\end{itemize}

In general, this presents evidence on the need for learning the weights of features for each topic as there is no specific selection of features that would separate various topics from each other.

Also, in order to show the power of Mutual Information criteria, in Table~\ref{table:top10MItopicsLocations} we present the top $5$ features for each topic. It can be observed that the different locations, hashtags, or terms shown as the top features based on Mutual Information are actually in relation with the specific topic.

\caption{Top 5 features for each topic based on Mutual Information}
\label{table:top10MItopicsLocations}
\end{table*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to answer the second question on whether any attributes correlate with importance for each feature, we provide two group of analysis. The first group, provides Mutual Information values for each feature across the feature's attribute values shown by violin plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:violinplots}. The attributes for each feature are:

\begin{itemize}
\item From: favorite count (the number of tweets the user has favorited), followers count (the number of users who follow the user), friends count (the number of users followed by the user), hashtag count (number of hashtags used by the user), tweet count (the number of tweets from the user)
\item Hashtag: tweet count, user count (the number of users using the hashtag)
\item Location: user count
\item Mention: tweet count
\item Term: tweet count
\end{itemize}

As we can see in the violin plots, the general pattern is that the greater the number of tweets, users, or hashtag count a feature has, the greater the chance of becoming topical will be. This pattern exists on other attributes of \textit{From} feature, although the pattern is less visible in comparison with the tweets, users, or hashtag count attributes. 
In addition, we further analyzed the density plots of favorite count, follower count, friends count, hashtag count attributes of \textit{From} feature as demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:densityplots}. Fig.~\ref{fig:densityplots} represents a bi-modality in the distribution of Mutual Information values across attributes dimension. Further analysis of data showed that the top mode belongs to users who have at least one topical tweet while the bottom mode are users with no topical tweets.
