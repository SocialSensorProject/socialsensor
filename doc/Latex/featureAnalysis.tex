%\textbf{What we have to work with: topics, features, feature attributes}
In this section, we analyze the informativeness of each feature for learning topical tweets by looking at different characteristics for each feature in our dataset. For example, one characteristic of hashtags could be the number of the tweets that contain those hashtags. Does this have an effect on importance of the hashtag when it comes to learning topical tweets or not. In this sense, this section would bring insights to the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{What are the best features for learning social sensors, do they differ by topic?}
\item \textbf{For each feature type, do any attributes correlate with importance?}
\end{itemize}

A famous method for measuring informativeness is Mutual Information which is a measure of amount of information one random variable contains about another random variable. In order to calculate amount of information that a feature $f_k \in \{from, hashtag, mention, term, location\}$ provides w.r.t $t_i \in \{NaturalDisaster, Epidemics, ...\}$, mutual information is defined as:

\begin{multline}
I(t_i, f_k)= \\
 \sum_{t_i\in \{ true, false \}} \sum_{f_k\in \{ true, false\}}p(f_k,t_i)\log \left ( \frac{p(f_k,t_i)}{p(f_k)p(t_i)} \right )
 \label{eq:eq1}
\end{multline}

Higher values for this metric indicates more informative features for the specified topic.

In order to answer the first question on what are the best features for learning social sensors, we provide mean of Mutual Information values for each feature across different topics in Table ~\ref{fig:avgMI}. The last column in this table shows average of mean Mutual Information for the feature. The following observations are from the analysis of Table ~\ref{fig:avgMI}:

\begin{itemize}
\item $Term$ feature is the most prevalent feature and in general, the more features you have, the better the chance that one is useful.
%\item $Term$ features provide more information for all of the topics on average which shows the importance of uni-grams when it comes to selection of topical tweet.
\item $Location$ and $Hashtag$ feature provide second and third most informative features respectively.
\item A few topics such as $IranDeal$ and tennis are less sensitive to selection of a specific features.
\item Location feature provides more information regarding $HumanDisaster$, $LBGT$, and $Soccer$ topics.
\item Sorting features based on their average mean values across different topics results in the following order: $Term$, $Location$, $Hashtag$, $Mention$, $From$
\end{itemize}

In general, this presents evidence on the need for learning the weights of features for each topic, because there is no specific selection of features that would separate various topics from each other.

Also, in order to show the power of Mutual Information criteria, we present the top $5$ features for each topic in table ~\ref{table:top10MItopicsLocations}. It can be observed how different locations, hashtags, or terms showed as the top features based on mutual information are actually in relation with the specific topic.

\caption{Top 5 features for each topic based on Mutual Information}
\label{table:top10MItopicsLocations}
\end{table*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to answer the second question on whether any attributes correlate with importance for each feature, we provide two set of analysis. The first one, provides Mutual Information values of each feature across feature's attribute values shown by violin plots in figure \ref{fig:violinplots}. The attributes for each feature are:

\begin{itemize}
\item From: favorite count (the number of tweets the user has favorited), followers count (the number of users who follow the user), friends count (the number of users followed by the user), hashtag count (number of hashtags used by the user), tweet count (the number of tweets from the user)
\item Hashtag: tweet count, user count (the number of users using the hashtag)
\item Location: user count
\item Mention: tweet count
\item Term: tweet count
\end{itemize}

As we can see in the violin plots, the general pattern is that the more number of tweets, users, or hashtags count a feature has, the higher the chance of becoming topical will be. This pattern exists on other attributes of $From$ feature, although a bit less clear than the tweets, users, or hashtags counts attributes. 
In addition, we further analyzed the density plots of favorite count, follower count, friends count, hashtag count attributes of $From$ feature shown in Fig ~\ref{fig:densityplots}. These plots represent a bi-modality in the distribution. Further analysis of data showed that the top mode belongs to users who have at least one topical tweet while bottom mode are users with no topical tweet.
