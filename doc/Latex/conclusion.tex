This work fills a major gap in 
event detection and tracking from social media
on identifying emerging topics from long-running themes with
minimal user supervision.  Our results suggest that these
sensors generalize well to unseen future topical content and provide a
novel paradigm for the extraction of high-value content from social
media.  Future work should explore the following enhanced topical
social sensor learning tasks: (1) optimizing rankings not only for topicality
but also to minimize the lag-time of novel content identification, (2) optimizing
queries for boolean retrieval oriented APIs such as Twitter, and (3) utilizing 
more social network structure to exploit a more expressive graph-based features.
