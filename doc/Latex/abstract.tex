Twitter represents a massively distributed social sensor of a rich underlying topic space that drives its content generation.  Yet Twitter content is so diverse, decentralized, and dynamic in nature, that it is hard to automatically aggregate this topical content.  To address this need, we provide a novel way of learning topical social sensors on Twitter that learn from a provided set of topical hashtags and generalize to identify topical tweets with previously unseen tags.  These learning social sensors leverage a variety of user-based, hashtag-based, term-based, and location-based features for distinguishing topical from non-topical tweets; we further analyze these features to understand which features are most useful and why.  We further assess general global topical trends and how our learning sensors are able to follow these trends by drawing from a rich variety of sources on the Twittersphere to enable a first generation of learning social sensors for Twitter.
