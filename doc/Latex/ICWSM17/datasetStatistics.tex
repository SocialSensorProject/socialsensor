Now we provide details of the Twitter testbed for topical social sensor learning
that we evaluate in this paper.  We crawled Twitter data using Twitter
Streaming API for two years spanning 2013 and 2014 years.
%This type of crawling provides us with a very sparse set of data, roughly $1\%$ of all tweets \footnote{\hyperref[]{http://allthingsd.com/20101110/twitter-firehose-too-intense-take-a-sip-from-the-garden-hose-or-sample-the-spritzer|}}. 
We collected more than 2.5 TB of compressed data, which contains a total number 
of $829,026,458$ english tweets. In the context 
of Twitter, we consider five feature types for each tweet.  Each
tweet has a \textit{From} feature (i.e., the person who tweeted it), a
possible \textit{Location} (i.e., a string provided as meta-data), and
a time stamp when it was posted.  A tweet can also contain one or more
of the following:
\begin{itemize}
%NOTE: $$ is not for italics... it is for math mode and has larger math mode spacing
%since adjacent letters are implicitly multiplied.  Use \textit -SPS
\item \textit{Hashtag}: a topical keyword specified using the \# sign.
\item \textit{Mention}: a Twitter username reference using the @ sign. % reply?
\item \textit{Term}:    any non-hashtag and non-mention unigrams. %These uni-grams are later cleaned to remove $Term$s with no meaning (total number of $Term$s before cleaning was $20,234,729$)
\end{itemize}
We provide more detailed statistics about each feature in
Table~\ref{table:featureStatistics}.  For example, there are
over 11 million unique hashtags, the most frequent unique hashtag
occurred in over 1.6 million tweets,
a hashtag has been used on average by $10.08$ unique users, and 
authors (\textit{From} users) have used a median value of $2$
tweets. % not average, median!!! -SPS

Fig.~\ref{fig:choropleths} shows per capita tweet frequency across
different international and U.S. locations for different topics.
While English speaking countries dominate English tweets, we see that
the Middle East and Malaysia additionally stand out for the topic of
Human Caused Disaster (MH370 incident), Iran, U.S., and Europe for nuclear
negotiations the ``Iran deal'', and soccer for some (English-speaking)
countries where it is popular.  For U.S. states, we see that Colorado
stands out for health epidemics (both whooping cough and pneumonic
plague), Missouri stands out for social issues (\#blacklivesmatter in
St. Louis), and Texas stands out for space due to NASA's presence
there.
