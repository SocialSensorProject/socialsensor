\section{Introduction}
Sensors are devices used for measuring some aspect of an environment and converting it into continuous or discrete value for use in information or control systems. For example, thermocouple as a sensor senses the temperature and converts it to continuous output voltage or a fire detector outputs a boolean value as a result of sensing smoke. Expanding on this definition, social media can be used as a sensor to detect important news e.g., death of Michael Jackson, real-time events e.g., earthquake or epidemics, sentiments and opinions e.g., people's political alignment towards political debates, preferences and traits e.g., stock market prediction or purchase behavior prediction.

However, due to the complexity of information in social media, designing sensors to detect specific phenomena requires highly specialized research to extract targeted information. Designing methodologies and extracting features that are robust to highly dynamic changes in social media, with various forms of expression e.g., informal, short, unstructured texts, written by individuals from different educational levels, and with large volumes of extraneous material mixed in is a difficult task in need of extensive research. 

This paper surveys existing work to explore social media as a sensor, methodology and features developed. This paper concludes by examining open areas for future research.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
\item too hard to label tweets
\item goal is to generalize from seed set of hashtags (Snowball : LOOK AT NEWMAN)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Learning Social Sensors}
Logistic Regression

\subsection{Baselines}
\begin{itemize}
\item random
\item top 100 tweeters of  topical tweets in train
\item top 100 mentions of topical tweets in train
\item top 100 terms of topical tweets in train
\item top 100 hashtags of topical tweets in train
\end{itemize}
Consider them as weights of 1, add up, rank the tweets

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Related Works}
social media event can be defined as an occurrence at a certain time interval and geographical region. It can be planned or unexpected e.g, concert vs. death of a celebrity, man-made or natural e.g., parade vs. earthquake, local or global e.g., concert vs. World Peace Day. Events can further be categorized based on their target users, including individuals, government agencies concerned about natural disasters and health epidemics, marketing companies, and news websites.  Historically, event detection has been studied extensively in text mining, NLP, and IR to find events from conventional media sources such as news streams  \cite{yang}. With the growth of social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and other microblogs, social media sites have become known as powerful communication tools for sharing and exchanging information about such events. However, event detection on social media sites is more challenging due to features such as unstructured and informal text, highly length restricted, generated by novice reporters compared to journalism-trained news editors.%, and generated in real time in many cases. 

Nevertheless, it is important to investigate event detection in social media because in comparison to traditional news blogs, social media has faster response time to events and time is money (marketing), lives (disasters), or simply relevance (new).

To see how different use cases address the aforementioned technical difficulties, we focus on the three highly studied types of event detections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Natural Disaster Detection}

\textbf{Predictive studies on disaster} \label{FP} \cite{sandy} studied the network of users and focused on choosing the best groups of users in order to achieve lead-times i.e. faster detection of disastrous event (following the concept of "friendship paradox"\footnote{On average, most people have fewer friends than their friends have}). On the other hand, \cite{sakakiEq2} used SVM classifier for detecting earthquake and employed location estimation method such as Kalman Filtering for localizing it. \cite{sakakiEq2} extracted statistical features e.g., the number and position of words in a tweet, keyword features and word context features. These studies investigated the real-time nature of Twitter and provided promising results.
%introduced in a seminal work by \cite{feld}, showing that "your friends have more friends than you do"

\textbf{Descriptive studies on disaster} Related works discuss the behavior of Twitter users during crisis \cite{vieweg, cheong, starbird} but do not address exploiting detection of crisis events. They investigated the use of social media during crisis in order to identify information propagation properties, social behavior of users e.g. retweeting behavior, information contributing to situational awareness, and active players in communicating information. However, this behavioral information could be exploited in development of sensors.

\item \textbf{Health Epidemic Detection}

\textbf{Content-based methods} \cite{culotta} and \cite{aramaki} both tried to identify influenza-related tweets and find correlations of these tweets to CDC statistics.  Both works extracted bag-of-words as features. As for methodology, the former used single and multiple linear regression showing that multiple linear regression works better, while the latter employed SVM. Results showed high correlation of their estimation of influenza in early stages with values from U.S CDC and Japan's Infection Disease Surveillance Center.

\textbf{Structure-based method} In contrast to previous methods, \cite{garcia} focused on a structure-related technique and developed a model for contagious information diffusion in a social network. They provided a method for choosing sensor groups from friends of random sets of users to find more central individuals in order to enforce early detection.

\textbf{Hybrid method} \cite{sadilek} exploited both content and structure information. They employed a semi-supervised approach to learn a robust SVM classifier by training two classifiers on a labeled set and then applying them to non-labeled tweets . This enabled them to model the interplay of social activity, human mobility, and the spread of infectious disease in a large real-world population. Further, \cite{sadelik} identified sick individuals from the content of online communication.
